# 0x02 Some tips

    ①the image mentioned above is issued by official insitute of the class,but is too old (ubuntu 10.04). so there are lots of tool you can't use,such as vscode、git and ssh. If i spend more time,I may resolve it,but may not. Now I use vim to write code.

    ②I try to use wsl with ubuntu 18.04,but when i type "./coolc",it tells me :the cooll is not compiled for i686. anything is useless like installing libc6-i386.

    If you have the solution about them,please tell me by push issues,I will be so delighted that I will cry loudly.
